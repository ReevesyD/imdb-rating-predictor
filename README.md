# imdb-rating-predictor
 The goal of this project is to build and critically analyze supervised machine learning methods for predicting IMDB movie ratings based on various predictor variables that include movie-title, duration, director and actor(s) names and facebook likes, keywords, genre, country, budget, and others.

The predictions were used as part of an in-class kaggle competition where our ranking was determined by accuracy on a hidden test set. I came 18th out of 400+ entrants. 

## Technology Used:
Python, Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## How To Run:
Ensure that the test and train datasets are stored within a sub-directory named project_data. The notebook will not run otherwise.

 ## Lessons Learned:
I learned how to preprocess data, perform feature analysis and engineering, visualise data trends and patterns, select and train models, hypertune parameters and evaluate models.
